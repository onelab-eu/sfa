We identify 3 layers in the server-side aspects:

. api: this object reacts to an incoming SFA request

. manager: this implements a given interface, either registry,
aggregate, or slicemgr

. driver: this object is in charge of actually talking to the
underlying testbed

-----

the generic layer is in charge of instantiating these and to link them
as follows:
* the classes actually used for creating the 3 elements are
configurable in a flavour (e.g. sfa.generic.pl.py)
* which is then configured from sfa-config-tty as SFA_GENERIC_FLAVOUR

* a call to make_api will then create the 3 elements with the
  following layout:

api.manager 
manager.driver
api.driver (for convenience)

------
example

from sfa.generic import Generic
generic=Generic.the_flavour()
-> returns an instance of a Generic object with a flavour from the
   config; by default it would thus be an instance of sfa.generic.pl

api = generic.make_api (...) returns an instance of the given class
with the arguments passed as arguments to the constructor
